#### Secondary

There are some testing programs that you might find interesting. Note that they are not intended for the real-world use and are not coded to the high security standards, so use them on your own risk.

There are also some programs that are not plugged into the CMake build system which you might want to find interesting. You would need to build those programs yourself. These programs reside in [`other/fun`](other/fun) directory.

## Building

### Requirements

#### Library dependencies

Library dependencies are listed in the [components](#components) table. The dependencies need to be satisfied for the components to be built. Note that if you don't have a dependency for some component, e.g. you don't have `libopus` installed required for building `toxav` component, building of that component is silently disabled.

#### Compiler requirements

The supported compilers are GCC and Clang.

In theory, any compiler that fully supports C99 and accepts GCC flags should work.

Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is not supported, as it doesn't fully support C99 and it doesn't support GCC compiler flags. However, it's possible to cross-compile Tox libraries to Windows using GCC or Clang and use them in a MSVC project.

You should have a C99 compatible compiler in order to build the main components. The secondary components might require the compiler to support GNU extensions.

#### Build system requirements

To build the main components you need to have CMake of at least 2.8.6 version installed. You also need to have pkg-config installed, the build system uses it to find dependency libraries.

Building was not tested on Windows, so it might not work without msys/cygwin, but we are interested in supporting native (i.e. from `cmd.exe`) Windows building and welcome contributions that help with that.

### CMake options

There are some options that are available to configure the build.

```

### Build process

#### Unix-like

Assuming all the [requirements](#requirements) are met, just run

```sh
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

#### Windows

##### Building on Windows host

###### cmd.exe

There are currently no instructions on how to build toxcore on Windows host in cmd.exe. Contribution of the instructions is welcome!

###### msys/cygwin

There are currently no instructions on how to build toxcore on Windows host in msys/cygwin. Contribution of the instructions is welcome!

##### Cross-compiling from Linux

These cross-compilation instructions were tested on and written for 64-bit Ubuntu 16.04. You could generalize them for any Linux system, the only requirements are that you have Docker version of >= 1.9.0 and you are running 64-bit system.

The cross-compilation is fully automated by a parameterized [Dockerfile](/other/docker/Dockerfile).

Install Docker

```sh
apt-get update
apt-get install docker.io
```

Get the toxcore source code and navigate to `other/docker`.

Build the container image based on the Dockerfile. The following options are available to customize the building of the container image.

| Name                | Description                                                    | Expected Value                      | Default Value |

  -t toxcore \
  .
```

Run the container to build toxcore. The following options are available to customize the running of the container image.

  --rm \
  toxcore
```

After the build succeeds, you should see the built toxcore libraries in `/path/to/where/output/build/result`.
